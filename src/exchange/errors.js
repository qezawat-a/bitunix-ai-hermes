/**
 * Bitunix error codes — taken VERBATIM from the official docs page
 * https://www.bitunix.com/api-docs/futures/ErrorCode/error_code.html
 *
 * This is the authoritative mapping: when the exchange returns a code, the
 * agent and the user get the exact message the exchange intended. Any code the
 * exchange returns that we do not know falls through to `describeError` which
 * shows the raw code — unknown codes are always better than a guessed message
 * that misdiagnoses the failure.
 *
 * Note: entries for 10009-10012 that existed before were pulled from a
 * different (non-futures) product's docs and were silently wrong; they are
 * removed here so nothing misreports.
